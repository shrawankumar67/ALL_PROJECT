# Credit Risk Analysis & Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer credit data to identify patterns in loan default behavior and builds machine learning models to predict credit risk.

The goal is to help financial institutions identify high-risk customers and improve lending decisions.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Default Rate Analysis
Calculated overall default percentage to understand portfolio risk level.

### 2️⃣ Loan Amount vs Risk
Analyzed whether higher loan amounts are associated with higher default probability.

### 3️⃣ Loan Duration vs Risk
Studied impact of credit duration on default behavior.

### 4️⃣ High Loan + Long Duration Segment
Identified risky customer segment based on above-median credit amount and duration.

### 5️⃣ Age-Based Risk Segmentation
Grouped customers into age categories and analyzed default patterns.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Two models were built:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

### Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---

## 🔍 Feature Importance
Random Forest was used to identify top risk-driving features affecting credit default.

---

## 📈 Risk Probability Scoring
Generated probability scores for each customer to identify high-risk individuals (>60% risk).

---

## 💡 Business Impact

This model can help banks:

- Detect high-risk borrowers
- Reduce loan default losses
- Improve credit approval decisions
- Implement risk-based pricing strategies

## 📂 Dataset
German Credit Dataset  
Used for academic and learning purposes.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add ROC-AUC evaluation
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Build interactive dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit)
- Deploy model as web application
